    One day I decided I wanted to build something in assembly, and this is the
    result of that. It is written in 16-bit real mode x86 assembly, and the
    binary is 512 bytes.  The binary is not a linux/windows application or
    something like that, it’s actually a bootable master boot record, and
    virtualbox is required to run it inside your current OS.
    </p>
    <img class="center-img tm15" src="img/fsg.png">
    <div class="caption">
      A screenshot of the game running in virtualbox. There are a few piles of
      sand with some water, and a smaller floating box with some more sand and
      water.
    </div>
    <p>
    The purpose of this article is to explain how this project was built, and to
    explain some of the pitfalls I experienced while learning assembly.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is">What is a falling sand game?</h2>
    <p>
    The quickest way to learn what a falling sand game is, is to go play a bit
    around with <a href="https://dan-ball.jp/en/javagame/dust/">this falling
    sand game</a>, from which I derived much of the inspiration for this game.
    </p>
    <p>
    A falling sand game is a simulation game where various materials can be
    spawned into the world, which then will interact in various ways. My game
    has four materials: air, wall, water and sand. Air and wall will simply stay
    fixed and do nothing, while water and sand will both fall if suspended in
    the air. Sand will form a pile on the ground while water will form a lake.
    </p>
    <h2 id="rules">Rules of the simulation</h2>
    <p>
    If you wants to make a simulation, you have to define the rules that the
    simulation follows. The rules for this simulation are the following:
    </p>
    <ol start="0">
      <li>The world is a grid, where each cell has one of four possible
        states:</li>
      <li>Air never does anything, but might be replaced with other moving
        objects. Air is represented with a space.</li>
      <li>Wall never does anything, but objects cannot move through wall. Wall
        is represented with a <code>#</code> symbol.</li>
      <li>Water will fall straight down if there is air below. If there is
        something else below, water will randomly move left or right. Water is
        represented with a <code>~</code> symbol.</li>
      <li>Sand will fall straight down if there is air or water below. If any of
        the three blocks below the sand are air, the sand will move randomly
        left or right. Sand is represented with a <code>.</code> symbol.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    The most interesting rule is the rule for sand. The chosen rule for sand
    means that sand wont move around randomly if you put it on something flat,
    but if you try to build a tall tower of sand, it will collapse into a pile.
    </p>

    </div>
    <h2 id="set-up">Setting up assembly</h2>
    <p>
    The assembly I’m writing is real-mode raw x86 assembly, which means it’s
    going to run as its own OS, instead of inside your OS. However it would be
    convenient not having to reboot after every change. Therefore one should set
    up a suitable environment for development. The environment consists of two
    things: an assembler and a virtual machine. The assembler is the assembly
    equivalent of a compiler, and the virtual machine allows you to run your new
    OS inside your current OS.
    </p>
    <p>
    In my project, I’ve used the assembler <a href="http://www.nasm.us/">nasm</a>
    and the virtual machine <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.
    After setting up these tools, below is an example file, which prints “Hello
    World”.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="x86asm">BITS 16
  ; Set up the memory segment used
  mov ax, 7C0h
  mov ds, ax

  ; Move the address of the hw string into the si register
  mov si, hw
  ; jump to the print label and return here when the instruction ret is called
  call print

  ; when we reach this label, we sleep forever
halt:
  ; this instruction causes the processor to sleep until next interrupt
  hlt
  jmp halt

  ; this function prints a zero-terminated string to the teletype
print:
  ; save all registers on the stack
  pusha
  ; initialize the values of the ah and bh registers
  ; ah contains the action that the bios should take, in this case we want to
  ; print to the teletype
  mov ah, 0Eh
  ; clear the bh register. when printing to the teletype, this register contains
  ; the page to which will be written
  xor bh, bh
  ; clear the direction flag (this flag is used by the lodsb instruction)
  cld
.repeat:
  ; saves the byte pointed to by the register si in the register al and
  ; increment si (if the direction flag is set, si is instead decremented)
  lodsb
  ; compare the register al to zero (al is the next byte of the string)
  cmp al, 0
  ; if it is equal to zero, jump to .end, since we have reached the end of the
  ; string
  je .end
  ; call the 10h interrupt. The value in ah determines what the bios should do
  ; when this interrupt is called. The value 0Eh means "print to the teletype".
  int 10h
  ; print the next character
  jmp .repeat
.end:
  ; restore all the registers to the value they had when pusha was called
  popa
  ; return to the location from which print was called
  ret

  ; db stands for data byte. This line saves the string Hello World in the
  ; binary. The 10 and 13 are a newline and the zero is the end of the string
  ; hw is simply the label for this string
  hw db 'Hello World', 10, 13, 0
  ; this line pads the file with zeroes, so it is exactly 512 bytes long
  times 510 - ($-$$) db 0
  ; required to mark the disk as executable
  dw 0AA55h</code></pre>
  <p>
  In order to run the above code, compile it with <code>nasm helloworld.asm -o
    helloworld.flp</code> which will create a <code>.flp</code> file. In order
  to run this file, create a new virtual machine in VirtualBox without a hard
  drive, and then open the settings of your new virtual machine, and under
  Storage you add a floppy controller in which you put the <code>.flp</code>
  file.
  </p>
  <h3 id="keyboard">Accessing the keyboard</h3>
  <p>
  The keyboard is accessed by defining what code should run when some keyboard
  event occurs. A simple keyboard handler is is shown below:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="x86asm">keyboardhandler:
  ; save the state of the registers
  pusha

  ; read the keyboard key in to the register al
  in al, 60h

  ; check if the highest bit is set. this bit defines whether or not the key was
  ; pressed
  test al, 80h
  ; if the bit is set, jump to .released
  jnz .released

.pressed:
  ; insert code to handle a pressed key here ...
  jmp .end

.released:
  xor al, 80h
  ; insert code to handle a released key here ...
.end:
  ; finish the handling of the key
  mov al, 20h
  out 20h, al
  popa
  ; this instruction returns from an interrupt
  iret</code></pre>
  <p>
  The code above defines how to handle a keyboard event. Now you just need to
  register the keyboard handler:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="x86asm">push ds ; register keyboard handler
push word 0
pop ds
cli
mov [9h * 4], word keyboardhandler
mov [9h * 4 + 2], word 7C0h
sti
pop ds</pre></code>
  <p>
  In order to register the keyboard handler, you can put the above code just
  after the <code>mov ds, ax</code> instruction shown in the hello world
  example.
  </p>
  <p>
  Unfortunately the keycodes given to the handler don’t have real relation to
  the keyboard layout, which means you will have to embed the keyboard layout in
  the program in order to handle typing properly.
  </p>
  <h3 id="timing">Timing</h3>
  <p>
  Timing in bare x86 assembly is not very easy. Luckily there is a chip on your
  processor called the <a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/Programmable_Interval_Timer">programmable
  interval timer</a>. This chip can be configured to send an interrupt with a
  set frequency. Read the linked osdev article for more information on using
  this timer, but below is the code that worked for me:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="x86asm">mov al, 36h
out 43h, al
mov ax, 11931 ; 100 Hz
out 40h, al
mov ah, al
out 40h, al</code></pre>
  <p>
  The above code tells the timer to interrupt the hardware one hundred times per
  second. When used together with the fact that the <code>hlt</code>
  instruction, causes the processor to wait until the next interrupt, this
  allows timing. The timer chip runs at 1.193182 MHz, and the constant 11931 in
  the code above means that this will give a frequency of 100 Hz.
  </p>
  <h2 id="the-game">The game</h2>
  <p>
  This part of the article will show the various parts of the code and explain
  them.
  </p>
  <h3 id="memory">The memory layout</h3>
  <p>
  We need somewhere to store the information from the application. The game
  board is 80 by 24 tiles, and if we use one byte per tile, this means we need
  1920 bytes. Besides that, we have a few other variables that are placed in
  memory:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>IS_STEPPING_FLAG:</b> 0 when the game is
      paused, and 1 otherwise.</li>
    <li><b>POSITION:</b> The index of the cursor on the
      screen.</li>
    <li><b>CLOCK_STEP:</b> Counts clock pulses from the timer chip.</li>
    <li><b>IS_SPAWNING:</b> 1 if a key for spawning stuff is currently pressed,
      0 otherwise.</li>
    <li><b>SPAWNING_TYPE:</b> Contains the type of item that is currently being
    spawned.</li>
    <li><b>RANDOM:</b> State for the random number generator.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  I decided to put the tiles at memory index 1000–2920 and the above values at
  the memory indexes just below 1000. The value stored at memory index 999 is
  the <code>IS_STEPPING_FLAG</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
  I actually used a bit more than 1920 bytes for the game board, since the
  easiest way to avoid sand and water falling out of the map was to just add an
  invisible wall below the map.
  </p>
  <p>
  We define these memory locations in the assembly code as shown below:
  </p>
  <pre><code>%define RANDOM 993
%define SPAWNING_TYPE 994
%define IS_SPAWNING 995
%define CLOCK_STEP 996
%define POSITION 997
%define IS_STEPPING_FLAG 999
%define STATE 1000</pre></code>
  <p>
  Notice how the byte <code>IS_STEPPING_FLAG</code> is at position 999, while
  <code>STATE</code> is at 1000. This means if something at position
  <code>[STATE+0]</code> tries to move to the left, it will try to move into the
  <code>IS_STEPPING_FLAG</code>. The thing is, if it tried to move, the game is
  stepping, meaning the <code>IS_STEPPING_FLAG</code> is 1. Since the byte for
  wall is 1, this will block the move from <code>[STATE+0]</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
  This is the kind of hack you would normally avoid, but when you’re limited to
  512 bytes, you have to do some ugly stuff.
  </p>
  <p>
  We also define a few other constants:
  </p>
  <pre><code>; how many clock pulses from the 100 Hz clock should happen for each game step?
%define CLOCK_STEPS_PER_STEP 2
%define WIN_W 80
%define WIN_H 24
%define WIN_SIZE (WIN_W*WIN_H)</pre></code>
  <h3 id="impl-keyboard">Implementation of the keyboard handler</h3>
  <p>
  In the <a href="#keyboard">previous section about the keyboard</a> a template
  for keyboard handlers was introduced. The keyboard handler in this game uses
  this template.
  </p>
  <p>
  The game handles pressed keys by checking for various possible options and
  jumping to a handler specific to the key. Below the jumps are shown:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="x86asm">.pressed:
  ; figure out what key it was
  ; cl is used in .spawn, and is 0 if the key was released
  mov cl, 1
  cmp al, 1fh ; 0x1f is S
  je .swap_step
  cmp al, 48h
  je .arrow_key_up
  cmp al, 50h
  je .arrow_key_down
  cmp al, 4bh
  je .arrow_key_left
  cmp al, 4dh
  je .arrow_key_right
  ; the number keys are 02h, 03h, 04h and so on
  cmp al, 02h
  jge .spawn

  jmp .end</code></pre>
  <p>
  With this method we have thus successfully dispatched to an appropriate
  handler. The code at <code>.spawn</code> handles when the number keys are
  pressed, which will change the current tile to the material corresponding to
  the pressed key. This is done with the following code:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="x86asm">.spawn:
  ; back in the jump handler, we jumped as long as the key id was at least the
  ; one corresponding to the key 1. We still have to check it is not some key
  ; with a larger key id than this key.
  cmp al, 05h
  jg .end
  ; al is the key code, the number keys start at 02h, so we change the interval
  ; to fit the desired values
  sub al, 02h
  mov [SPAWNING_TYPE], al
  mov byte [IS_SPAWNING], cl ; cl corresponds to the press/release status
  jmp .end</code></pre>
  <p>
  The code computes the correct type for the tile and stores it at memory
  location <code>SPAWNING_TYPE</code> and the <code>cl</code> register, which
  specifies whether or not the key was pressed or released, is saved in the
  memory location at <code>IS_SPAWNING</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
  The implementation of <code>.swap_step</code> is much simpler. Unlike the
  previous code, this code is only run when the key pressed.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="x86asm">.swap_step:
  xor byte [IS_STEPPING_FLAG], 1
  jmp .end</code></pre>
  <p>
  The binary operation <code>xor</code> is here used to swap the lowest bit of
  the <code>IS_STEPPING_FLAG</code>, and since this value is either 0 or 1, this
  means it will switch between those two.
  </p>
  <p>
  All the arrow keys have mostly identical code: simply check if the change
  would move the pointer out of bounds, and if not, move it. The code for one of
  the keys is shown below:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="x86asm">.arrow_key_down:
  ; we check whether we can move cursor down, and if so, do it
  mov ax, [POSITION]
  add ax, WIN_W
  cmp ax, WIN_SIZE
  jge .end
  mov [POSITION], ax
  jmp .end</code></pre>
  <p>
  This concludes the keyboard handler. The next section explains the code that
  updates the screen.
  </p>
  <h3 id="draw">Drawing the screen</h3>
  <p>
  The screen is an 80 by 25 terminal, which is called a teletype. It can be
  interacted with using the instruction <code>int 10h</code> and some
  documentation for this instruction can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INT_10H">here</a>.
  This teletype has functionality for drawing to a hidden page and then changing
  the shown page, avoiding stuff like screen tearing, however I haven’t used
  this in this project since I was limited to a 512 byte binary and it wasn’t
  causing any problems.
  </p>
  <p>
  The drawing code consists of two parts: a short initialization and a drawing
  loop. The initialization is shown below:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="x86asm">; make the cursor hidden
mov cx, 2607h
mov ah, 01h
int 10h</code></pre>
  <p>
  This call will hide the cursor, so a white block cursor wont be seen moving
  all over the screen while drawing is happening. The draw loop is rather
  simple:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="x86asm">print_state:
  ; this function draws the screen
  ; move cursor to upper left
  mov ah, 02h
  mov bh, 0
  mov dh, 0
  mov dl, 0
  int 10h

  mov bx, 0 ; character counter
.print_char:
  ; check if we are at the cursor, and if so we print 'x'.
  push bx
  cmp bx, [POSITION]
  jne .no_cursor
  mov al, 'x'
  jmp .print_now

.no_cursor:
  ; read state
  mov bl, [STATE+bx]      ; bl now contains the state
  mov bh, 0               ; clear bh, so bx contains the state
  mov al, [state_char+bx] ; state_char is an array of characters, so this
                          ; will fetch the character code for the state

.print_now:
  ; print character
  mov ah, 0eh
  mov bh, 0
  mov bl, 0
  int 10h
  pop bx

  ; next iteration
  inc bx
  cmp bx, WIN_SIZE
  jne .print_char
  ret</code></pre>
  <p>
  This code is a simple loop that moves the cursor to the upper right of the
  screen, and for each tile it first checks if we are at the tile specified by
  <code>POSITION</code> in which case we draw an <code>x</code>, otherwise we
  read the type of tile and fetch the appropriate character from the
  <code>state_char</code> array found at the end of the code. When the character
  has been found it is printed using an <code>int 10h</code> instruction.
  </p>
  <p>
  The code above stores the iteration index in the <code>bx</code> register, but
  also uses that register to perform the system call. The reason I didn’t use
  some other register for the iteration index is that most registers can’t index
  memory. The instructions <code>push bx</code> and <code>pop bx</code> allow
  saving the current value of <code>bx</code> while using the <code>bx</code>
  register for something else.
  </p>
  <h3 id="setup">Setting up the initial state</h3>
  <p>
  When the game starts, we want the game area to be filled with air, except for
  the walls, which should have wall blocks. This is something we need to do
  ourselves, and the code below will fill up the memory with the initial state.
  </p>
<pre><code>setup:
  ; make the cursor hidden
  mov cx, 2607h
  mov ah, 01h
  int 10h

  ; bx is our index into the STATE
  mov bx, 0

  ; clear_loop makes the entire map air
.clear_loop:
  mov byte [STATE+bx], 0 ; 0 is air
  inc bx
  cmp bx, WIN_W * (WIN_H - 1) ; compare bx with the index of the last air node
  jne .clear_loop             ; if there are more nodes, repeat the loop
  ; if we are at the end, fall into clear_loop_2

  ; clear_loop_2 makes the two lowest rows wall
  ; note that the lowest row is outside the view, but exists so water won't fall
  ; out, even if you remove the bottom of the world
.clear_loop_2:

  Setting up the initial state of the world is not the only initialization we
  need to do. We need to set up the timer and register the keyboard handler, as
  well as setting <code>CLOCK_STEP</code> so the game starts paused, and
  <code>IS_SPAWNING</code> since we don’t start the game pressing any key.
  </p>
  <code><pre>  ; set up timer
  ; the timer interrupts the hardware with 100 Hz
  mov al, 36h
  out 43h, al
  mov ax, 11931 ; 100 Hz
  out 40h, al
  mov ah, al
  out 40h, al

  ; register keyboard handler
  push ds
  push word 0
  pop ds
  cli
  mov [9h * 4], word keyboardhandler
  mov [9h * 4 + 2], word 7C0h
  sti
  pop ds

  ; The game is not running when we start.
  mov byte [CLOCK_STEP], 0
  ; We are also not currently pressing a key and spawning any objects.
  mov byte [IS_SPAWNING], 0

  ; after setting up the game, we fall directly into the step_start procedure</code></pre>
  <p>
  This finishes the setup code. After the setup code, we can continue to the
  most important part: actually running the game.
  </p>
  <h3 id="stepping">Game stepping</h3>
  <p>
  The code below runs the game. First it runs some simple code that updates the
  screen, then it checks if the game is paused, and if not, it uses the timer to
  run the next step at the appropriate time.
  </p>
  <pre><code>step_start:
  ; this makes it harder for the primitive random number generator to enter a
  ; short period
  add byte [RANDOM], 1

  ; update the screen
  call print_state
  ; check if we are spawning (holding a key that creates stuff)
  cmp byte [IS_SPAWNING], 1
  jne .nospawn
  ; we are spawning!
  ; save the newly spawned item to the game state
  mov bx, [POSITION]
  mov al, [SPAWNING_TYPE]
  mov [STATE+bx], al

.nospawn:
  ; check if we are currently running the simulation
  cmp byte [IS_STEPPING_FLAG], 0
  je next_step_start

.do_step:
  ; yep, the game is running
  ; let's check if it's time to do a game tick
  mov al, [CLOCK_STEP]
  cmp al, CLOCK_STEPS_PER_STEP
  je really_do_step
  inc al
  mov [CLOCK_STEP], al
next_step_start:
  ; it is not yet time for another game step
  hlt ; wait for next interrupt (timer)
  jmp step_start</pre></code>
  <p>
  If we jumped to <code>really_do_step</code>, then the game is not paused, and
  the timer says it’s time to run a step. Running a step is essentially done by
  going through every location in the game world, figuring out which type of
  block it is, and running the appropriate code in order to perform the correct
  update.
  </p>
  <p>
  One important consideration is that if something is changed during the step,
  we must avoid hitting that item again later during the same step. One example
  is falling: if we go through items from the top to bottom, any falling item
  would be updated again when we are processing the next line. Because of this,
  we go through the states from the bottom to the top, as nothing moves up.
  <p>
  We also need to make sure we handle items moving to the left correctly.
  </p>
  </p>

  This concludes the main code of the program.

  <h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h3>
  <p>
  To wrap up, we need some boilerplate code that makes the BIOS accept the
  floppy disk. We put this at the top of the assembly code:
  </p>
  <pre><code>BITS 16
  mov ax, 7C0h
  mov ds, ax</pre></code>
  <p>
  And at the end:
  </p>
  <pre><code>  ; a char array describing how the items look
  state_char db ' #~.'
  ; the file must be exactly 512 bytes, so we pad it with zeroes
  times 510 - ($-$$) db 0
  dw 0AA55h</pre></code>
  <p>
  Here the <code>state_char</code> is an array containing the characters used
  for the four item types in our game. The <code>times</code> instruction pads
  our binary to be exactly 512 bytes.
