    I’ve created a printed circuit board (PCB) that simulates the game of life
    on a 5&nbsp;by&nbsp;5 LED grid, and can be remote controlled with Bluetooth.
    The project was created in collaboration with another student as a school
    project. Here is a video of the finished product:

    <h2>What is The Game of Life?</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_life">The Game of life</a> is
    a simulation that runs in some two-dimensional grid of cells. The simulation
    is run in steps, where the next step depends only on the state of the
    previous. Each cell in the simulation is either dead or alive in each step.
    </p>
    <h3>Rules for computing the next step</h3>
    <p>
    The simulation is build from three rules dictating the state of each cell.
    The state of each cell in the next step, is found by first counting how many
    of the 8 cells around it are live, and using one of these rules:
    <ul>
      <li>If there are 2 alive neighbours, the state of the cell is not changed.</li>
      <li>If there are 3 alive neighbours, the cell is alive in the next step.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, the cell is dead in the next step.</li>
    </ul>
    This is performed on every cell in the grid, and results in the next state.
    Often when simulating the game of life, the grid is infinitely large, but I
    don’t have that many LEDs, so my grid is just a 5&nbsp;by&nbsp;5 grid. There
    are two ways to handle finite grids: Just let the grid have an edge, or let
    it wrap around.  I’ve chosen to let the grid wrap around, since this allows
    me to have a glider, that goes on forever.
    </p>
    <h3>The Glider</h3>
    <img class="float-img" src="img/glider.gif">
    <p>
    The configuration shown in the video at the start of the article is called
    a glider. It is a pattern that moves forever, and is small enough fit in
    my 5&nbsp;by&nbsp;5 grid, without interfering with itself over the edges.
    This is the best way to show the wrap around in this grid.
    </p>
    <h2>Hardware</h2>
    <p>
    The main challenge in this project is that the Arduino UNO doesn’t have
    enough digital outputs to control 25 LEDs. I solved this problem by adding 3
    shift registers, on which I push the state of the LEDs.
    </p>
    <h3>What is a shift register?</h3>
    <p>
    A shift register traditionally has 2 inputs and <i>n</i> outputs. Initially
    all the outputs of the shift register are LOW. The first input is called VAL
    and the second is called CLOCK. Every time the CLOCK input changes from LOW
    to HIGH, the first output is changed so it’s the same as the VAL input, and
    the second output is changed so it’s the same as the first output and so on.
    Since it takes <i>n</i> updates to the shift register, it allows you to
    trade ease of updating the outputs for more outputs.
    </p>
    <p>
    The reason we use a shift register in this project is to control many LEDs
    with a small amount of outputs from the arduino. I chain shift registers by
    connecting the last output from each shift register to the VAL input of the
    next, which allows me to control all the LEDs connected to the three shift
    registers, using a small amount of outputs from the Arduino.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the arduino code I have an array that maps an LED coordinate to the index
    in the shift register, which is how the code knows how to control each LED.
    </p>
    <p>
    The shift register used in this project has a few additional inputs: A, B,
    CLOCK and CLR. The VAL input I mentioned earlier is split into the inputs A
    and B, and the VAL input is regarded to have the value true only if both A
    and B are true. The CLR input just sets all outputs to low.
    </p>
    <p>
    In order to update the board once, the Arduino has to write to the shift
    registers 24 times. The reason that it needs to write 24 times, even though
    3 LEDs are connected directly to the Arduino is elaborated on in the
    Imperfections section.
    </p>
    <h3>The final design</h3>
    <p>
    The shift registers I used are called 74HC164N.
    </p>

      The design of the PCB quickly created in paint. All resistors are 330
      &Omega;.
    </div>
    <p>
    The circuit board is very simple; it just chains some integrated circuits
    and connects them to LEDs. The resulting layout, which I created from
    the design above is shown below:
    </p>

      circuits are 74HC164N.
    </div>
    <p>
    In hindsight, I probably shouldn’t have placed the 5V and ground inputs so
    close to each other. Here’s a picture of the finished PCB:

      The finished PCB. The board was just barely not wide enough for the
      layout, so I changed one of the outer traces to a wire.
    </div>
    <h2>Software</h2>
    <p>
    The software consists of two components:  the Arduino code and the Android
    app.
    </p>
    <h3>Arduino</h3>
    <p>
    The Arduino code is available
    <a href="https://github.com/Darksonn/gol-pcb-arduino">here</a>. The code
    needs to handle two things simultaneously: Running the game of life and
    receiving commands over Bluetooth. Bluetooth works by have the function
    <tt>serialEvent</tt> run every time new data is received via Bluetooth. To
    avoid changes to the <tt>gol</tt> array while the next step is being
    computed, the changes received via Bluetooth are stored in a separate array,
    and committed to the <tt>gol</tt> array when the step computation has
    completed. This results in a <tt>loop</tt> function like the one below:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="arduino">void loop() {
  // if we are not paused, compute the next the game of life step
  if (!paused) {
    delay(750);
    gol_step();
  }
  // move changes from the changes array to the gol array
  // the changes array is updated in the handleSerialData function,
  // when a bluetooth command decides to update the board
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; 25; ++i) {
    int x = i % 5, y = i / 5;
    if (changes[x][y] != 2) {
      gol[x][y] = changes[x][y];
      changes[x][y] = 2;
    }
  }
  // move the gol array to the array, which correctly maps coordinates to LEDs
  for (i = 0; i &lt; 25; ++i) {
    set(i % 5, i / 5, gol[i%5][i/5] == 1 ? HIGH : LOW);
  }
  // actually update the LEDs
  write_config();
}</code></pre>
    <p>
    Bluetooth works by sending a stream of characters, this means some method of
    signifying the end of a message is needed. In this project I’ve opted for
    delimiting commands with an exclamation mark. The Arduino accepts the
    command <tt>clr!</tt>, which clears the board, the commands <tt>g 0!</tt>
    and <tt>g 1!</tt>, which pause and unpause the board, and
    <tt>[ledid] [0 or 1]!</tt>, which turns a LED on or off.
    </p>
    <h3>Android</h3>
    <p>
    The Android code was written entirely by my partner in this project, so this
    section will be short. The android code is available <a
      href="https://github.com/Darksonn/gol-pcb-android">here</a>, and a picture
    of the app is shown below:
    </p>
    <img class="center-img" style="max-width:300px;" src="img/gol-android.png">
    <div class="caption">
      Screenshot of the app created for this project.
    </div>
    <p>
    In order for the app to keep in sync with the Arduino, updates must be sent
    both back and forth. Updates are sent from the phone to the Arduino when the
    user interacts with the app, and the entire state is sent from the Arduino
    to the app when the Arduino computes the next the game of life step.
    </p>
    <h2>Imperfections</h2>
    <p>
    Unfortunately there are some imperfections present in this project. The main
    one has to do with the design of the circuit board. If you look at the
    Arduino code, you will see the following workaround:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="arduino">// Stores the configuration of the board.
char configuration[27];
// maps a coordinate to an LED
int mapping[5][5] = {
  {26, 25, 24, 23, 22},
  {1, 0, 21, 20, 19},
  {3, 2, 18, 17, 15},
  {5, 4, 14, 12, 13},
  {7, 6, 11, 10, 9}
};</code></pre>
    <p>
    Notice how the <tt>configuration</tt> array has the length 27 instead of 25?
    Notice how the <tt>mapping</tt> array doesn’t have an entry for 8 and 16?
    These things are because the QH outputs of the shift registers aren’t
    connected to an LED, like the other outputs are. Instead, they are just
    connected to the input of the next shift register.
    </p>
    <p>
    This means that the Arduino has to control 3 LEDs directly, instead of just
    one.
    </p>
