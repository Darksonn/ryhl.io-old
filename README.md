# ryhl.io

I have a github pages site on [ryhl.io](http://ryhl.io/). This is a semi-modular
makefile mush that I use to generate the contents of ryhl.io.

The static html pages generated by this Makefile are pushed to
[https://github.com/Darksonn/Darksonn.github.io](https://github.com/Darksonn/Darksonn.github.io).
